ðŸ“š C Programming Projects â€“ Certura Internship

This repository contains a collection of C programming projects developed during my Certura Internship. Each project demonstrates problem-solving, file handling, string manipulation, and mathematical concepts using C language.

ðŸš€ Projects Included

## 1. Mini Library Management System

A simple library management system that allows users to:
Add a new book record
Remove a book by title
Search for a book by title
List all books in the library
Save and load data using a text file


## 2. VigenÃ¨re Cipher Encryption Tool

An implementation of the VigenÃ¨re Cipher, a classical encryption algorithm.
Features:
Encrypt a given message with a key
Decrypt the cipher back to original message
Handles both uppercase and lowercase characters


## 3. Quadratic Equation Solver

A program to solve quadratic equations of the form axÂ² + bx + c = 0.
Features:
Calculates discriminant
Finds real and distinct roots
Finds equal roots
Handles complex roots


ðŸ“Œ Internship Note

These projects were developed as part of my Certura Internship training tasks to strengthen my C programming concepts including:
File handling
String manipulation
Conditional logic
Mathematical computation


âœ¨ This repo serves as a record of my learning journey in C programming.
